#### Project Description
Developed a full bioinformatics pipeline focusing on the principles of reproducibility and portability. This RNAseq analysis consists of sample quality control, alignment, quantification and differential expression analysis. This project generated an end-to-end pipeline to complete RNA sequencing and differential expression analysis.


#### Introduction
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of insulin producing pancreatic B-cells, with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) being a gene that plays a critical role in this autoimmunity. With a loss of function of the TYK2 gene in B-cells, it was found that the progression of T1D was halted and losing TYK2 can protect against type 1 diabetes. This study was performed to observe the role of the TYK2 gene in B-cell development while confirming that inhibiting this gene is successful at stopping type 1 diabetes progression. The authors used deep RNA sequencing to observe the expression patterns of TYK2 and other candidate genes. Also, RNA sequencing was used to compare the expression of genes in both the wild type (WT) and TYK2 knockout (KO) groups to observe any differences with the absence of TYK2.
